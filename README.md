# Violence-Detection
This project aims to develop a system for detecting violent actions in videos using deep learning techniques. Leveraging a dataset of video clips, this implementation extracts frames from the videos and processes them through a deep learning model based on Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The model incorporates attention mechanisms to enhance its ability to recognize patterns over time, improving classification accuracy for detecting violent versus non-violent actions.
